# MindCare: ML for Mental Health Insights  

## Overview  
MindCare is a machine learning model that predicts mental disorders based on symptoms and behavioral traits. It uses data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification techniques to analyze mental health patterns.  

## Features  
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with bar charts and correlation heatmaps  
- Feature selection to improve model accuracy  
- Machine learning classification using Random Forest  
- Model evaluation with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## Results  
- Achieved 79.16% accuracy in predicting mental disorders  
- Identified key symptoms contributing to different diagnoses  

## Future Scope  
- Improve prediction with deep learning models  
- Develop an interactive web application for real-time mental health insights
